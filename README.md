# Node-MongoDb-Pi
This is a simple shell script that will install the lates NodeJs, git (if you don't have git), and MongoDB.  
It compiles the MongoDB binary, and the process will take about a couple of hours.

 All I did was place this in a shell script for easy downloading and install via a bash script.<p>
 You can run this Bash script with: <p>
 $sudo bash Install-Node-MongoDb-Pi-sh
