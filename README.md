# Node-MongoDb-Pi
This is a simple shell script that will install NodeJs v4.2.4, git (if you don't have git), and MongoDB.  The "Latest version" of Node in the raspberry pi repo is version 0.something.somthing. Too old, and this script will compile v4.2.4.<p>
The script then compiles the MongoDB binary, and the process will take about a couple of hours.

 All I did was place this in a shell script for easy downloading and install via a bash script.<p>
 You can run this Bash script within the folder you extract the script with the command: <p>
 $sudo bash Install-Node-MongoDb-Pi-sh
